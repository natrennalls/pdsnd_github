Other than using the Udacity class examples for a frame of reference, I also tried to model out the raw data function
using the video in the lesson, as well as some examples of similar processes embedded within the lesson. When running into
roadblocks, a lot of mt troubleshooting went thru Google and searching for an appropriate answwer to the given questions
for this projects, but with little help, so I sought assistance from my two friends who are Python developers. I asked them
to give me guidance on some of the smaller pieces of code that weren't making much sense, but the resepected that this needed
to be done by myself to have a deeper understanding of the language.
